      <h2>Aquarius</h2>
      <p>Although you want to be pragmatic while moving forward, it’s nearly impossible to keep your mind on the essentials. Making concrete plans enables you to progress with confidence. However, spiritual Neptune’s gentle presence in your 2nd House of Finances reminds you that there’s a metaphysical component to money, too. The seen and unseen worlds both offer worthwhile opportunities for investments of your time. Deciding what you value most determines your options.</p>

      <h2>Pisces</h2>
      <p>There is an uneasy relationship between reality and your imagination today. Unfortunately, you can’t just choose one over the other, even if each seems to be operating independently. Nevertheless, fact and fiction are merely two sides of the same coin and cannot be separated. Functioning in the real world while still honoring your need for fantasy is not just a compromise; it’s a viable strategy for satisfaction and success.</p>

      <h2>Aries</h2>
      <p>Stepping into the middle of a disagreement seems like the right thing to do today, especially if you could help reestablish harmony. Your diplomatic inclinations lead you to believe that your words can smooth over ruffled feathers and put others at ease. However, you might just as easily misread the entire situation and make matters worse. Avoid the tendency to charge ahead with your unilateral plan without considering the needs of all involved. Surprise others with your kindness and grace.</p>

      <h2>Taurus</h2>
       <p>Balancing your personal goals at work with those of the group may be more challenging than you expect. You could get off to a bad start today if you jump to an inaccurate conclusion based upon your past experiences rather than the current situation. In fact, projecting your fears onto everyone else is not a helpful strategy. Instead, ask questions and listen carefully to the spaces in between the words. Practicing compassion by opening your heart and your mind is a surefire way to set you back on a productive course.</p>

      <h2>Gemini</h2>
      <p>You are acutely aware of how your words can alter the overall mood of people around you. You are extra mindful of everyone else’s feelings now and want to be a force for positive change. However, too much thinking turns a simple plan into a logistical nightmare. Oftentimes you need to slow down and reconsider your message before saying something you later regret. Today, it’s more important to express yourself before the moment passes you by. Authenticity matters.</p>

      <h2>Cancer</h2>
      <p>You want to speak your mind but are afraid of stepping too far out of line today. You believe that others expect you to be supportive of their efforts even if you’re not totally on board with their plans. Nevertheless, you need to stay true to your fundamental values, despite any inconveniences you may create by sharing your thoughts. Ultimately, you won’t regret your actions now if you let your integrity do the talking.</p>

      <h2>Leo</h2>
      <p>Asking lots of questions is one method of obtaining missing information, but you might actually know more than you realize now. Nevertheless, you don’t like it when you feel as if you’re being pressured to act before you’re ready to make a choice. Instead of overreacting by digging in your heels to delay the process, trust your intuition and take a leap of faith. Author Robert Kiyosaki wrote, “The biggest risk a person can take is to do nothing.“</p>

      <h2>Virgo</h2>
      <p>Yesterday’s certainty morphs into today’s doubt. Ironically, your wavering self-confidence is prompted by someone else’s questionable behavior. You know that there are many strategies for improving your attitude, but you might not know where to begin. Unfortunately, asking others for help will only confuse matters further now. The answers to your questions must come from within; no one can tell you what to do. Believe in yourself; your journey is yours and yours alone.</p>

       <h2>Libra</h2>
       <p>Your reputation for fair-mindedness is more important to you than anything else today. But deceptive Neptune can mislead communicator Mercury and the Sun as they travel through your 1st House of Self, sending you down the proverbial rabbit hole. You might be so clever that you almost end up deceiving yourself. Fortunately, the crisis could be averted if you set clear objectives and focus on your top priorities. Nevertheless, you must still keep your eyes on the open horizon or you could get lost in the minutiae. Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf said, “If your dreams don’t scare you, they aren’t big enough.“</p>

      <h2>Scorpio</h2>
      <p>Being creative might be a lot more fun if you can keep your work private today, but your friends won’t leave you alone. You may secretly worry that your finished product won’t meet their demanding expectations. Nevertheless, your imagination is so vivid now that you can’t help but express your originality through your art. There’s no reason to stop from singing your song. Dr. Wayne Dyer wrote, “Don’t die with your music still inside you.“</p>

      <h2>Sagittarius</h2>
      <p>No one is surprised that you've got something to say. Thanks to the rather startling array of energies the universe has directed your way, you are ready, willing and able to let it fly. Do yourself a favor: Before you actually begin speaking, think about all possible repercussions of your comments. Do you really want to alienate anyone you come into contact with, or can you settle for just speaking your mind to the one person who deserves it the most?</p>

      <h2>Capricorn</h2>
      <p>When you are out shopping or wandering today, the more unusual your find, the more you'll absolutely have to call it your own. That goes particularly for arts and crafts, but maybe also for people who happen to possess qualities you're fond of. Before you get too involved, be sure there is more connecting you than just one shared cause or opinion. Kindred spirits are great to have around, but if you're after a long-term relationship, there needs to be a bit more to it.</p>
